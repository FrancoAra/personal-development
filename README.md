# Growth Path

The intention of this repository is to record my personal progress in the fields of Functional Programming and Category Theory.

Each month I will use github's issue tracker to propose a milestone and manage my progress towards it.

Each concept must be reached to the `practiced` mastery level (or in WoW terms `epic` :P). The `mastered`/`legendary` mastery level is only reached with future field practice.
