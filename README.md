# Growth Path

The intention for this repository is to record my personal progress in the fields of Functional Programming and Category Theory, also share it and have a compilation of the resources I am using.

Each month I will use github's issue tracker to propose a milestone and manage my progress towards it.

Each concept must be reached to the `practiced` mastery level (or in WoW terms `rare` :P). The `mastered`/`legendary` mastery level is only reached with future field practice.

Each concept must be applied in at least 2 programming languages (mostly Scala and Haskell)

Also the logbooks are saved in parseable simple text format for possible future analysis.
