# Growth Path

The intention for this repository is to record my personal progress in the fields of Functional Programming and Category Theory, also share it and have a compilation of the resources I am using.

Each month I will use github's issue tracker to propose a milestone and manage my progress towards it.

Each concept must be reached to the `practiced` mastery level (or in WoW terms `rare` :P). The `mastered`/`legendary` mastery level is only reached with future field practice.

Each concept must be applied in at least 2 programming languages (mostly Scala and Haskell)

Also the logbooks are saved in parseable simple text format for possible future analysis.

# dec2016 logbook

* |07-12-2016|| Created the repository and made the plan for December 2016, also found two resources for typeclasses laws.
* |08-12-2016|[[1]](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Monoids)[[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82dqVrS8ik)[[3]](http://www.idris-lang.org/example/)| Studied [1] #1, was curious about the monoid instances implementations in Haskell, also learnt how to deal with multiple type class instances of the same type (by wrapping them into a newtype) and how finding good homomorphisms between monoids can help you do nice refactorings. Also watched [2] #1 #2 and got pretty excited about Idris and program proofs as an alternative to property based testing, now I understand the concept of dependant types. That led me to read [3].
* |10-12-2016|[[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nyGVgGEKdA&feature=youtu.be)[[2]](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/index.html)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_type)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union)[[5]](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995)| Saw [1] which gave me a really good intro to "optics" #6. Started [2] to get into Idris, which seems really exciting. By reading [3] and [4] I got a much better understanding of product types and coproducts. Also did some exercises on tuples from [5] for #3. I also understand better the overall concept of the curry-howard isomorphism and made me very excited.
* |11-12-2016|[[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKore-AkisY&t=2739s)| Just saw [1] gotta find some time to learn about streams and Rx. Also talked a lot with Haidy, that woman simply makes me happy xd.
* |12-12-2016|[[1]](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995)[[2]](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/stream/stream-introduction.html)[[3]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31554707/compare-rxscala-with-akka-stream)| Read some more about tuples and started the relationship concept in [1] for #3, also after reading [3] I read some of [2].
