“i dont know” vs “I dont know yet”

At least 1/5 of our time must be invested in self improvement, may it be theoretical knowledge, technical skill or human kindness.

Promote unity between humans; in every trip, in every line of code, in every new discovery. No matter race, religion (even non functional programming), sexual preference, etc.

## Vidtecci Ideology

Science and engineering ultimate goal must be to protect and enhance life in the cosmos. As scientist and engineers it is our responsibility to actively find this goal in each of our activities.

Vidtecci is an acronym for "Vida, Tecnología, Ciencia", which translated from Spanish means "Life, Technology, Science".

Be kind to all living things.

Love what you do and let your MAIN activities have purpose.

Study logic and the abstracts of nature to become a better human.

Have a [critical mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), question everything reasonably.

Understand and develop emotional intelligence.
