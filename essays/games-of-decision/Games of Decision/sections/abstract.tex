Collective decisions in intelligent multi-agent systems are done every day on different domains, choosing new laws, accepting github pull requests, doing business contracts or choosing family vacations location; normally a decision system is set before taking such decisions: democracy, autocracy or something in between. They all are important for the multi-agent system in order to progress, and also if abstracted they all have common parameters, which when changed the whole decision system changes. This open research draft proposes such abstract model, enlists some of its applications, shows how it can model some popular political systems and proposes several new decision systems. Also research opportunities are exposed for future work.
