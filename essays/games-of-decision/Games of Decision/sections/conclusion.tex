Decision models and systems are of core importance for humanity, we have been developing them since we first started living in community. In order to further understand this phenomena and develop the systems that will dictate our future, we need to mathematically model and understand them, so that automated and powerful systems are conceived. This research draft has proposed such model, and then proved its utility by modeling some political systems and also by proposing decision systems that address some domain specific issues. Also a list of further research topics is proposed and exposed to the scientific and engineering community.

Humanity as the writing of this text is confronting several alarming challenges, and given the critical mass that population has reached, modern systems must be proposed and applied. This research hopes only for the best, for the future of the human as species, and for the survival of life in the universe.
