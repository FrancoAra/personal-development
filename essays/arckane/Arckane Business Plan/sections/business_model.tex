\section{Busienss Model}\label{business_model}

\paragraph{} In this section we will explain the business model canvas, since Arckane is working on top of two industries we will use labels, in figure \ref{fig:modelcanvas} \textbf{(p)} purple is referencing the education industry, \textbf{(a)} aqua is referencing the recruiting industry and \textbf{(y)} yellow is referencing general Arckane activities. Self explanatory topics will just be listed.

% SUBSECTION: Value Proposition

\subsection{Value Proposition}\label{valueproposition}

\paragraph{(p) Easily find and pay for tailor made education:} Finding tutors and paying them is as easy as doing a couple of taps in the app. As described in section \ref{justification} the distributed education system enables tutors to have deep knowledge of the status of their apprentices. 1) They can directly see in the ontology what is the proficiency of all the specific skills of the apprentice, making placement exams unnecessary. 2) The results of the research on education enables us to create apprentice profiles (what they are more stimulated with, what are the techniques that have worked the best with them, etc.) and this profile is improved over time with help of the tutors. Also machine learning can be used to make Arckane learn how apprentices learn, making an automatic recommendation system of the best resources and tutors that suit the apprentice learning styles. 

\paragraph{(p) Easily offer and charge for teaching any skill:} It is easy to offer tutoring through Arckane thanks to the automatic scheduling system, all you have to do as a tutor is tell Arckane your free times and wait for new apprentices to come. Also receiving payments is easy because Arckane charges the apprentices beforehand, tutors have nothing to worry about charging. Also Arckane can recommend the tutor how much to charge for different skills since in the system we know the offer and demand of tutoring for all the skills.

\paragraph{(p) Education becomes cheaper:} The factors that will lower the education price are: 1) There are no institutions with bureaucracy involved. 2) The system automates logistics. 3) The tutoring market is digitalized, so working and studying the economy characteristics is faster, easier, better and some time automatic. 4) Combined with the digital skill market we can transform education into education on demand, people can develop ONLY the skills they need, and do not have to waste valuable resources (money and time) on skills they may never use.

\paragraph{(p) Arckane is dedicated to making you an amazing tutor:} Since we are creating an automated digital system with a very good business model Arckane can use its efforts and resources in researching education, studying the distributed education system fenomenas and bringing new knowledge, tools and techniques to the tutors, this value is given to every tutor in the world, giving massive reach to education research. 

\paragraph{(a) Instantly find talent:} Since Arckane has a complete, objective, certified and granular database of the skills the apprentices process (with levels of proficiency) we can offer a search engine for talent which perfectly matches the needs of the query, one may search sets of skills with different proficiencies and other criteria like geolocation. This creates an open digitalized skill market, where anyone can find talent, from a plumber, a cook, or a software engineer.

\paragraph{(a) Organizations save a lot of money, time and resources in recruiting:} Last proposition value also applies to companies, we can offer reliable automatic talent matchmaking that satisfy the necessities of the company. Also companies can post job skill sets, a publication of what are the skill profiles they are looking for in different positions, then apprentices can work in creating those skills and achieving the level of proficiency needed, this way we can also convert education into education on demand.

\paragraph{(a) Automatically find job for any of your skills:} Any apprentice can offer their skills in the skill market, which can be constantly be looking for projects or jobs for them, from freelance projects, research groups or long term jobs.

\paragraph{(a) Get rating of your skills by organizations:} When an apprentice has been employed the organization can rate new levels of proficiency and newly obtained skills, this way apprentices can reflect their improvements to the system by working or participating in projects.

\paragraph{(a) Organizations can attract employees using the reputation system:} Organizations gain reputation when they rate their employees skills, reputation that reflects how much employees can improve when working in the organization (and on which skills). Also organizations can build in this way a profile of the skills currently being used inside the organization.
